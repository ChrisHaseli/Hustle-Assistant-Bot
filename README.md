# Hustle-Assistant-Bot
This repository contains a voice-activated personal assistant project that automates various tasks such as managing applications, sending emails, setting reminders, and fetching news headlines. Developed using Python, this bot integrates speech recognition and text-to-speech functionalities for hands-free interactions. The project is built with external APIs and system processes to enhance productivity.

Key Features:
- Automated Task Management: Easily manage tasks like emails and reminders.
- Voice Command Processing: Uses Pythonâ€™s speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries for seamless interaction.
- External API Integration: Fetches real-time data, such as news headlines, to keep users informed.
- Scalability: Designed for future enhancements and updates based on user feedback.

This project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, machine learning, and voice-based automation, as well as my experience integrating various APIs to build user-friendly solutions.
